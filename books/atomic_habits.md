## Power of Atomic Habits

### Be 1% better every day and you'll be 37x better in a year

-   small victories lead to big wins üöÄ
-   what important! Small mistakes lead to big failures ü´£
-   Great example, when a plain change in the angle of a plane ‚úàÔ∏è can lead to a huge difference in the destination. First it's not noticeable, but after a long time, it's a huge difference.

```javascript
// translation for devs

learn something new every day, read one article, watch one video, write one line of code.

seek for small improvements in your code, it will lead to a huge difference in the long run.
```

### How to understand progress?

-   progress is not a linear process, it's exponential üìà
    -   many people give up when they don't see enough progress, but in reality, they are just at the beginning of the exponential curve
        -   We call it the "valley of disappointment", you have to survive it to see the results üôè
-   When you succeed, people around you will say you achieved it overnight. But in reality, it's a result of small habits and actions you've been doing for a long time.

```javascript
// translation for devs

you won't become a senior developer overnight, it's a result of small habits and actions you've been doing for a long time.

you will be disappointed about your progress, but you have to survive it to see the results. Keep going! üôè
```

### Focus on the system, not the goal

-   Focus on systems that leads to the goal, not the goal itself.
    -   "Result will take care of itself if you take care of the process" - Bill Walsh (NFL coach)
-   Why?
    -   Winners and losers have the same goals, but winners have better systems.
    -   Goals are temporary, you need system to keep order and progress.
    -   Goals is only a momentary satisfaction, but systems are a long-term satisfaction.
    -   What if you achieved your goal? You will stop? No, you need a system to keep going.

```javascript
// translation for devs

Focus on improving your coding skills, not on getting a job.

Focus on building a habit of learning, not on learning a specific technology.
```

## How habits shape your identity (and vice versa)

-   Focus on who you want to become
    -   If you decide to quit smoking but you don't believe in it internally, there is a low chance that you will succeed
        -   Decide to become a person who cares about health, smoke quitting will become a natural result for you
    -   What you do indicates the person you think you are
    -   Habit that is part of your identity will be strong
        -   The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a readerÔøº
-   Habits (repeating actions) help you to believe that you can become who you want to be
    -   The best way to change who you are is to change what you do every day
    -   Decide what person you want to be, prove it to yourself with small victories (daily work)
-   If you don't know who you want to become, think about what type of person would achieve what you want?
    -   What kind of person could write a book? Probably someone systematic and reliable
-   Remember! You can always change who you are!

```javascript
// translation for devs

If you want to become a senior developer, start acting like one. Start writing articles, sharing your knowledge, and helping others.
```

## 4 steps to build a new habit

-   behavior that is followed by a positive outcome is usually repeated, while behavior that is followed by a negative outcome is usually avoided
-   Past behavior is a good predictor of future behavior
-   Habits allow our mind to delegate repetitive tasks to the subconscious, so that we can focus on what is new and developmental at that time
-   Habits gaining consists of 4 steps, always in the same order
    -   Cue (spotting a reward)
        -   Encourages the brain to start a behavior
        -   Our brain constantly analyzes the environment for signals suggesting a reward, it works like a reward detector
    -   Craving (desire for the reward)
        -   You don't desire the habit, but the change of a certain state
        -   You din't want to turn on the TV, but to be entertained
        -   Desires are individual, everyone perceives signals differently, has different associations with desire
    -   Reaction (getting the reward)
        -   It's in form of thought or action
        -   You must have the skills to act, you won't do everything you desire (e.g. throw a ball into the basket)
    -   Reward
        -   It's the end of the habit loop, it's the reason why the habit is repeated
        -   Learn us what is worth doing in the future to be rewarded again
-   If behavior int any of the 4 steps is not satisfying, the habit will not be born
    -   Remove cue and the habit will never start
    -   Lower the craving you won't have enough motivation to act
    -   Make it hard to act and you won't be able to do it
    -   if the reward doesn't satisfy the craving, you won't have a reason to repeat the action
-   How to build a good habit
    -   Make it obvious
    -   Make it attractive
    -   Make it easy
    -   Make it satisfying
-   How to get rid of a bad habit
    -   Make it invisible
    -   Make it unattractive
    -   Make it hard
    -   Make it unsatisfying
-   Change you behavior by asking questions
    -   How can I make it obvious?
    -   How can I make it attractive?
    -   How can I make it easy?
    -   How can I make it attractive?
-   Each goal set against human nature is doomed to fail

```javascript
// translation for devs

If you want to build a habit of learning, 
make it obvious by setting a reminder, 
make it attractive by learning something interesting, 
make it easy by setting a specific time, and make it satisfying by rewarding yourself after learning.

If you want to get rid of a bad habit of procrastination, 
make it invisible by blocking distracting websites, 
make it unattractive by setting a punishment for procrastination, 
make it hard by setting a specific time for work, and make it unsatisfying by setting a punishment for procrastination.
