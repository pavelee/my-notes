## Power of Atomic Habits

### Be 1% better every day and you'll be 37x better in a year

- small victories lead to big wins üöÄ
- what important! Small mistakes lead to big failures ü´£
- Great example, when a plain change in the angle of a plane ‚úàÔ∏è can lead to a huge difference in the destination. First it's not noticeable, but after a long time, it's a huge difference.

#### translation for devs

- learn something new every day, read one article, watch one video, write one line of code.
- seek for small improvements in your code, it will lead to a huge difference in the long run.

### How to understand progress?

- progress is not a linear process, it's exponential üìà
  - many people give up when they don't see enough progress, but in reality, they are just at the beginning of the exponential curve
    - We call it the "valley of disappointment", you have to survive it to see the results üôè
- When you succeed, people around you will say you achieved it overnight. But in reality, it's a result of small habits and actions you've been doing for a long time.

#### translation for devs

- you won't become a senior developer overnight, it's a result of small habits and actions you've been doing for a long time.
- you will be disappointed about your progress, but you have to survive it to see the results. Keep going! üôè

### Focus on the system, not the goal

- Focus on systems that leads to the goal, not the goal itself.
  - "Result will take care of itself if you take care of the process" - Bill Walsh (NFL coach)
- Why?
  - Winners and losers have the same goals, but winners have better systems.
  - Goals are temporary, you need system to keep order and progress.
  - Goals is only a momentary satisfaction, but systems are a long-term satisfaction.
  - What if you achieved your goal? You will stop? No, you need a system to keep going.

#### translation for devs

- Focus on improving your coding skills, not on getting a job.
- Focus on building a habit of learning, not on learning a specific technology.

## How habits shape your identity (and vice versa)

- Focus on who you want to become
  - If you decide to quit smoking but you don't believe in it internally, there is a low chance that you will succeed
    - Decide to become a person who cares about health, smoke quitting will become a natural result for you
  - What you do indicates the person you think you are
  - Habit that is part of your identity will be strong
    - The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a readerÔøº
- Habits (repeating actions) help you to believe that you can become who you want to be
  - The best way to change who you are is to change what you do every day
  - Decide what person you want to be, prove it to yourself with small victories (daily work)
- If you don't know who you want to become, think about what type of person would achieve what you want?
  - What kind of person could write a book? Probably someone systematic and reliable
- Remember! You can always change who you are!

#### translation for devs

- If you want to become a senior developer, start acting like one. Start writing articles, sharing your knowledge, and helping others.
