## Power of Atomic Habits

### Be 1% better every day and you'll be 37x better in a year

- small victories lead to big wins 🚀
- what important! Small mistakes lead to big failures 🫣
- Great example, when a plain change in the angle of a plane ✈️ can lead to a huge difference in the destination. First it's not noticeable, but after a long time, it's a huge difference.

_translation for devs_

- learn something new every day, read one article, watch one video, write one line of code.
- seek for small improvements in your code, it will lead to a huge difference in the long run.

### How to understand progress?

- progress is not a linear process, it's exponential 📈
  - many people give up when they don't see enough progress, but in reality, they are just at the beginning of the exponential curve
    - We call it the "valley of disappointment", you have to survive it to see the results 🙏
- When you succeed, people around you will say you achieved it overnight. But in reality, it's a result of small habits and actions you've been doing for a long time.

_translation for devs_

- you won't become a senior developer overnight, it's a result of small habits and actions you've been doing for a long time.
- you will be disappointed about your progress, but you have to survive it to see the results. Keep going! 🙏

### Focus on the system, not the goal

- Focus on systems that leads to the goal, not the goal itself.
  - "Result will take care of itself if you take care of the process" - Bill Walsh (NFL coach)
- Why?
  - Winners and losers have the same goals, but winners have better systems.
  - Goals are temporary, you need system to keep order and progress.
  - Goals is only a momentary satisfaction, but systems are a long-term satisfaction.
  - What if you achieved your goal? You will stop? No, you need a system to keep going.

_translation for devs_

- Focus on improving your coding skills, not on getting a job.
- Focus on building a habit of learning, not on learning a specific technology.
