# HTML

## Site sections

### header
The header HTML element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.
### main
The main HTML element represents the dominant content of the body of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.
**Should be only main section!**
#### article
The article HTML element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.
#### aside
The aside HTML element represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.
#### nav
The nav HTML element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.
**on site there could be a few nav sections**
#### section
The section HTML element represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions.
#### address
The address HTML element indicates that the enclosed HTML provides contact information for a person or people, or for an organization.
### footer
The footer HTML element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element. A footer typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.
